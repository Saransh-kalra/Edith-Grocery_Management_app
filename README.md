# Edith - The Grocery Management App
A user-friendly android application to manage purchased grocery items, keep track of perishable items, and efficiently use food in their pantry for exciting new recipes. The project is intended for android users and can be further expanded into an IOS application based on demand. The application-focused approach ensures the accessibility of the app, makes it easy to use, and encourages wide user adoption to facilitate efficient use of pantry items into fast new recipes.
This new application to assist users in grocery management is expected to -
- Notify users of unused pantry items before the food expiration.
- Notify users to dispose of expired items, in case they fail to utilize them on time, thus triggering psychological guilt to prevent future waste.
- Suggest users wide varieties of recipes from different cuisines based on existing pantry in an order of items likely to be expired soon.
- Analyze customer preferences on food, amount, and quality based on previously purchased products.
- Recommend users new purchases that can be effectively used in recipes.
- Recommend users with previous purchases currently out of stock in the userâ€™s pantry based on the analysis of user preferences.
- Allow users to create custom recipes based on items in stock.
- Allow users to set custom food reminders based on user preferences ranging from hours to days to prevent constant disturbance through the app.
- Allow users to maintain a shopping list for the grocery, with an option to keep track of weekly items.
- Allow user to add or delete inventory based on what has been consumed or expired.
- Allow users to set custom expiration/shelf life of purchased products.
- Apply humor with reminders to keep users engaged.
- Scan receipts to enter purchased pantry items to reduce user input.

This is just an MVP with login, user registration, UI design, inventory management functionalitites
